# Video Analyzer

A video analyzer that displays whether the video is suitable for the workplace (NSFW), detects faces, and predicts age and genders while the video is analyzed frame by frame.

This repository contains an implementation of Yahoo's Open NSFW Classifier rewritten in tensorflow.

The original caffe weights have been extracted using Caffe to TensorFlow. You can find them at pretrained_models/open_nsfw-weights.npy.


## Getting Started

You will need to download the weights and pre-trained models as described in the pretrained_models folder.  Links to be provided later.


### Prerequisites

I will provide a full listing of all of the prerequisites later.


### Usage

I will describe this later.
