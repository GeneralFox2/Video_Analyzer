This is the pre-trained engines folder. The path to this folder is hard coded in the application.  

One engine is used for NSFW predictions (open_nsfw-weights.npy).  
The original caffe weights were extracted using Caffe to TensorFlow.  

The other engine uses a Keras implementation of a CNN network for age and gender estimation,  
and uses the IMDB-WIKI dataset (weights.28-3.73.hdf5).
